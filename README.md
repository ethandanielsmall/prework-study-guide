# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is the prework study guide! It was created to refer back to about basics that were learned during the prework, which is designed to act as an optional foundation for the course work. I want to do a good job in this class because I believe it could be one of many keys to setting me up to live the life I want, so I have done my best to make a prework page before class begins!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This guide is to be used as just that, a guide! It is currently a place where notes can be referred back to, and in the future can be a place where new notes are kept.
